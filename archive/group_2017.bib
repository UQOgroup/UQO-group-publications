  abstract = {Molecular frame high-harmonic spectra of aligned N 2 molecules reveal
	a Cooper-like minimum. By deconvolving the laboratory frame alignment
	distribution, what was previously thought to be a maximum of emission
	along the molecular axis is found to be maxima at 35 degrees off
	axis, with a spectral minimum on axis. Both of these features are
	supported by photoionization calculations that underline the relationship
	between high-harmonic spectroscopy and photoionization measurements.
	The calculations reveal that the on axis spectral minimum is a Cooper-like
	minimum that arises from the destructive interference of the p and
	f partial wave contributions to high-harmonic photorecombination.
	Features such as Cooper minima and shape resonances are ubiquitous
	in molecular photoionization or recombination. Published by the American
	Physical Society. © Published by the American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Quantum interference of single photons is a fundamental aspect of
	many photonic quantum processing and communication protocols. Interference
	requires that the multiple pathways through an interferometer be
	temporally indistinguishable to within the coherence time of the
	photon. In this Letter, we use a diamond quantum memory to demonstrate
	interference between quantum pathways, initially temporally separated
	by many multiples of the optical coherence time. The quantum memory
	can be viewed as a light-matter beam splitter, mapping a THz-bandwidth
	single photon to a variable superposition of the output optical mode
	and stored phononic mode. Because the memory acts both as a beam
	splitter and as a buffer, the relevant coherence time for interference
	is not that of the photon, but rather that of the memory. We use
	this mechanism to demonstrate nonclassical single-photon and two-photon
	interference between quantum pathways initially separated by several
	picoseconds, even though the duration of the photons themselves is
	just ∼250 fs. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

	treated geometrically, with the aligned ensemble cast in terms of

	can be sensitive to fine details of the alignment, i.e. higher-order
	moments of the axis distribution, which are often neglected in experimental

	from an analysis of dimensionless ratios of simple geometrical measures
	such as the x and y dimensions, perimeter, and image area. For an
	ensemble of images containing a mixture of different habits, the
	distribution of a particular ratio will be a linear superposition
	of basis distributions of ratios of the individual habits. The fraction
	of each habit in the ensemble is found by solving the inverse problem.
	One of the advantages of the suggested scheme is that it provides
	recognition analysis of both 'complete' and 'partial' images, that
	is, images that are completely or partially contained within the
	sample area of the probe. The ability to process 'partial' images
	improves the statistics of the recognition by approximately 50% when
	compared with retrievals that use 'complete' images only. The details

	world and the quantum, microscopic one continues to be poorly understood.
	Expanding the regime of observable quantum behaviour to large-scale
	objects is therefore an exciting open problem. In macroscopic systems
	of interacting particles, rapid thermalization usually destroys any
	quantum coherence before it can be measured or used at room temperature.
	Here, we demonstrate quantum processing in the vibrational modes
	of a macroscopic diamond sample under ambient conditions. Using ultrafast
	Raman scattering, we create an extended, highly non-classical state
	in the optical phonon modes of bulk diamond. Direct measurement of
	phonon coherence and correlations establishes the non-classical nature
	of the crystal dynamics. These results show that optical phonons
	in diamond provide a unique opportunity for the study of large-scale
	quantum behaviour, and highlight the potential for diamond as a micro-photonic
	quantum processor capable of operating at terahertz rates.},

	Combining these functions in a light-matter interface that can be

	sources of entangled photons, is an important step towards these
	applications. To date there have only been a few demonstrations of

	arbitrary spectral and temporal manipulations of individual quantum
	optical pulses. Using weak coherent optical pulses at the few photon

  abstract = {Nonperturbative quantum control schemes in the intermediate field
	strength (nonionizing) regime are investigated. We restrict the matter-field
	interaction to the nonresonant dynamic Stark effect (NRDSE) as induced
	by infrared laser fields, which we argue is a new and general tool
	for quantum control of atomic and molecular dynamics. For the case
	of Raman coupled matter states, an effective Hamiltionian may be
	constructed, and quantum control via NRDSE may be thought of as reversibly
	modifying the effective Hamiltonian during system propagation, thus
	leading to control over dynamic processes. As an illustration, the

	turn on and sudden turn off of the NRDSE is considered and experimentally
	demonstrated. Wave packets generated through the switched NRDSE interaction
	may be very different in form and content than wave packets generated

	packet dynamics where the NRDSE manifests itself as molecular axis

	pulse. This switched laser pulse was generated via a plasma shuttering
	technique, giving a pulse with a rise time of 150 ps and a fall time

	sphingomyelin (SM) mixtures as a function of surface pressure and

	addition. Heterogeneous SM mixtures with a mixture of acyl chain

	consistent with the strong hydrogen bonding capacity of SM leading
	to well-ordered monolayers over a range of surface pressures. The

	consideration for high input state photon loss, auxiliary state photon
	loss, detector inefficiency and coupling loss, detector dark counts,
	and non-number-resolving detectors. We also analyze the two schemes
	when multiplexed arrays of non-number-resolving detectors are used.
	Furthermore, we explore the possibility of utilizing spontaneous
	parametric down-conversion as the auxiliary photon pair source required
	by the enhanced scheme. In these different cases, we determine the
	bounds on the detector parameters at which the enhanced scheme becomes
	superior to the standard scheme and describe the impact of the different
	imperfections on measurement success rate and discrimination fidelity.
	This is done using a combination of numeric and analytic techniques.
	For many of the cases discussed, the size of the Hilbert space and
	the number of measurement outcomes can be very large, which makes
	direct numerical solutions computationally costly. To alleviate this
	problem, all of our numerical computations are performed using pure
	states. This requires tracking the loss modes until measurement and
	treating dark counts as variations on measurement outcomes rather
	than modifications to the state itself. In addition, we provide approximate
	analytic expressions that illustrate the effect of different imperfections
	on the Bell-state analyzer quality. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

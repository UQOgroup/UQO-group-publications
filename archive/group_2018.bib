  Abstract                 = {Molecular frame high-harmonic spectra of aligned N 2 molecules reveal a Cooper-like minimum. By deconvolving the laboratory frame alignment distribution, what was previously thought to be a maximum of emission along the molecular axis is found to be maxima at 35 degrees off axis, with a spectral minimum on axis. Both of these features are supported by photoionization calculations that underline the relationship between high-harmonic spectroscopy and photoionization measurements. The calculations reveal that the on axis spectral minimum is a Cooper-like minimum that arises from the destructive interference of the p and f partial wave contributions to high-harmonic photorecombination. Features such as Cooper minima and shape resonances are ubiquitous in molecular photoionization or recombination.

  Abstract                 = {Quantum frequency conversion is a powerful tool for the construction of hybrid quantum photonic technologies. Raman quantum memories are a promising method of conversion due to their broad bandwidths. Here we demonstrate frequency conversion of THz-bandwidth, fs-duration photons at the single-photon level using a Raman quantum memory based on the rotational levels of hydrogen molecules. We shift photons from 765 nm to wavelengths spanning from 673 to 590 nm - an absolute shift of up to 116 THz. We measure total conversion efficiencies of up to 10% and a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 4.0(1):1, giving an expected conditional fidelity of 0.75, which exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3. Thermal noise could be eliminated by cooling with liquid nitrogen, giving noiseless conversion with wide tunability in the visible and infrared. {\copyright} 2017 American Physical Society.},

This is an example of quantum noise amplification using the most noise-free process possible: near unitary quantum evolution. The use of phase offers robustness to classical pump noise and the ability to generate multiple bits per measurement. The Stokes light is generated with high intensity and as a result, fast detectors with high signal-to-noise ratios can be used for measurement, eliminating the need for single-photon sensitive devices.

We introduce a quantum random number generator based on the measurement of pulse energy quantum fluctuations in Stokes light generated by spontaneously-initiated stimulated Raman scattering. Bright Stokes pulse energy fluctuations up to five times the mean energy are measured with fast photodiodes and converted to unbiased random binary strings. Since the pulse energy is a continuous variable, multiple bits can be extracted from a single measurement. Our approach can be generalized to a wide range of Raman active materials; here we demonstrate a prototype using the optical phonon line in bulk diamond.},

Interference requires that the multiple pathways through an interferometer be temporally indistinguishable to within the coherence time of the photon. In this Letter, we use a diamond quantum memory to demonstrate interference between quantum pathways, initially temporally separated by many multiples of the optical coherence time. The quantum memory can be viewed as a light-matter beam splitter, mapping a THz-bandwidth single photon to a variable superposition of the output optical mode and stored phononic mode. Because the memory acts both as a beam splitter and as a buffer, the relevant coherence time for interference is not that of the photon, but rather that of the memory. We use this mechanism to demonstrate nonclassical single-photon and two-photon interference between quantum pathways initially separated by several picoseconds, even though the duration of the photons themselves is just ∼250 fs. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

The second-order correlation of the memory output is g(2)(0)=0.65±0.07, demonstrating a preservation of nonclassical photon statistics throughout storage and retrieval. The memory is low noise, high speed and broadly tunable; it therefore promises to be a versatile light-matter interface for local quantum processing applications. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate a dual-rail optical Raman memory inside a polarization interferometer; this enables us to store polarization-encoded information at GHz bandwidths in a room-temperature atomic ensemble. By performing full process tomography on the system, we measure up to 97 ± 1% process fidelity for the storage and retrieval process. At longer storage times, the process fidelity remains high, despite a loss of efficiency. The fidelity is 86 ± 4% for 1.5 μs storage time, which is 5000 times the pulse duration. Hence, high fidelity is combined with a large time-bandwidth product. This high performance, with an experimentally simple setup, demonstrates the suitability of the Raman memory for integration into large-scale quantum networks. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Photon pair sources have wide ranging applications in a variety of quantum photonic experiments and protocols. Many of these protocols require well controlled spectral correlations between the two output photons. However, due to low cross-sections, measuring the joint spectral properties of photon pair sources has historically been a challenging and time-consuming task. Here, we present an approach for the real-time measurement of the joint spectral properties of a fiber-based four wave mixing source. We seed the four wave mixing process using a broadband chirped pulse, studying the stimulated process to extract information regarding the spontaneous process. In addition, we compare stimulated emission measurements with the spontaneous process to confirm the technique{\textquoteright}s validity. Joint spectral measurements have taken many hours historically and several minutes with recent techniques. Here, measurements have been demonstrated in 5--30 s depending on resolution, offering substantial improvement. Additional benefits of this approach include flexible resolution, large measurement bandwidth, and reduced experimental overhead. {\copyright} 2018 Optical Society of America.},

  Abstract                 = {Bulk diamond phonons have been shown to be a versatile platform for the generation, storage, and manipulation of high-bandwidth quantum states of light. Here we demonstrate a diamond quantum memory that stores, and releases on demand, an arbitrarily polarized $\sim$250 fs duration photonic qubit. The single-mode nature of the memory is overcome by mapping the two degrees of polarization of the qubit, via Raman transitions, onto two spatially distinct optical phonon modes located in the same diamond crystal. The two modes are coherently recombined upon retrieval and quantum process tomography confirms that the memory faithfully reproduces the input state with average fidelity 0.784$\pm$0.004 with a total memory efficiency of (0.76$\pm$0.03)%. In an additional demonstration, one photon of a polarization-entangled pair is stored in the memory. We report that entanglement persists in the retrieved state for up to 1.3 ps of storage time. These results demonstrate that the diamond phonon platform can be used in concert with polarization qubits, a key requirement for polarization-encoded photonic processing. {\copyright} 2017 American Physical Society.},

Large frequency shifts are needed for conversion between optical and telecommunication frequencies, while smaller shifts are useful for frequency-multiplexing quantum systems, in the same way that wavelength division multiplexing is used in classical communications. Here we demonstrate frequency and bandwidth conversion of single photons in a room-temperature diamond quantum memory. Heralded 723.5 nm photons, with 4.1 nm bandwidth, are stored as optical phonons in the diamond via a Raman transition. Upon retrieval from the diamond memory, the spectral shape of the photons is determined by a tunable read pulse through the reverse Raman transition. We report central frequency tunability over 4.2 times the input bandwidth, and bandwidth modulation between 0.5 and 1.9 times the input bandwidth. Our results demonstrate the potential for diamond, and Raman memories in general, as an integrated platform for photon storage and spectral conversion.},

Additionally, analysis of the full photoelectron image stack provides a quantum beat imaging modality, in which the Fourier components of the photoelectron images correlated with specific beat components can be obtained. This may also permit the extraction of isotope-resolved photoelectron images in the frequency domain, in cases where nuclear spins (hence beat components) can be uniquely assigned to specific isotopes (as herein), and also provides phase information. The information content of both raw, and inverted, image stacks is investigated, suggesting the utility of the Fourier analysis methodology in cases where images cannot be inverted.},

  Abstract                 = {We bring the methodology of orienting polar molecules together with the phase sensitivity of high harmonic spectroscopy to experimentally compare the phase difference of attosecond bursts of radiation emitted upon electron recollision from different ends of a polar molecule. This phase difference has an impact on harmonics from aligned polar molecules, suppressing emission from the molecules parallel to the driving laser field while favoring the perpendicular ones. For oriented molecules, we measure the amplitude ratio of even to odd harmonics produced when intense light irradiates CO molecules and determine the degree of orientation and the phase difference of attosecond bursts using molecular frame ionization and recombination amplitudes. The sensitivity of the high harmonic spectrum to subtle phase differences in the emitted radiation makes it a detailed probe of polar molecules and will drive major advances in the theory of high harmonic generation. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

Thanks to deterministic entanglement swapping operations via Rydberg-based two-qubit gates, and to the suppression of multiexcitation errors by the blockade effect, the entanglement distribution rate of the present scheme is higher by orders of magnitude than the rates achieved by other ensemble-based repeaters. We also show how to realize temporal multiplexing with this system, which offers an additional speedup in entanglement distribution. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum light–matter interfaces are at the heart of photonic quantum technologies. Quantum memories for photons, where non-classical states of photons are mapped onto stationary matter states and preserved for subsequent retrieval, are technical realizations enabled by exquisite control over interactions between light and matter. The ability of quantum memories to synchronize probabilistic events makes them a key component in quantum repeaters and quantum computation based on linear optics. This critical feature has motivated many groups to dedicate theoretical and experimental research to develop quantum memory devices. In recent years, exciting new applications, and more advanced developments of quantum memories, have proliferated. In this review, we outline some of the emerging applications of quantum memories in optical signal processing, quantum computation and non-linear optics. We review recent experimental and theoretical developments, and their impacts on more advanced photonic quantum technologies based on quantum memories. Â© 2016 The Author(s).

  Abstract                 = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Angle-resolved (AR) RABBITT measurements offer a high information content measurement scheme, due to the presence of multiple, interfering, ionization channels combined with a phase-sensitive observable in the form of angle and time-resolved photoelectron interferograms. In order to explore the characteristics and potentials of AR-RABBITT, a perturbative 2-photon model is developed; based on this model, example AR-RABBITT results are computed for model and real systems, for a range of RABBITT schemes. These results indicate some of the phenomena to be expected in AR-RABBITT measurements, and suggest various applications of the technique in photoionization metrology.},

  Abstract                 = {Single and multi-photon ionization of aligned molecular ensembles is examined, with a particular focus on the link between the molecular axis distribution and observable in various angle-integrated and angle-resolved measurements. To maintain generality the problem is treated geometrically, with the aligned ensemble cast in terms of axis distribution moments, and the response of observables in terms of couplings to these moments. Within this formalism the angular momentum coupling is treated analytically, allowing for general characteristics - independent of the details of the ionization dynamics of a specific molecule - to be determined. Limiting cases are explored in order to provide a phenomenology which should be readily applicable to a range of experimental measurements, and illustrate how observables can be sensitive to fine details of the alignment, i.e. higher-order moments of the axis distribution, which are often neglected in experimental studies. We hope that this detailed and comprehensive treatment will bridge the gap between existing theoretical and experimental works, and provide both quantitative physical insights and a useful general phenomenology for researchers working with aligned molecular ensembles. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

We absolutely refute this assertion and the spirit of the comment, although we do agree with Baykusheva {\&} W$\backslash$"orner that the textbook theory is correct. In a short response, Response to Comment on "Time delays in molecular photoionization" [3], we have already provided a clear rebuttal of the comment, but gave no technical details. In this fuller response we extend those brief comments in the spirit of completeness and clarity, and provide three clear rebuttals to Baykusheva {\&} W$\backslash$"orner based on (1) logical fallacy (category error), (2) theoretical details of the original article, (3) textural content of the original article. In particular, rebuttal (1) clearly and trivially points to the fact that there is no issue here whatsoever, with recourse to theoretical details barely required to demonstrate this, as outlined in the short version of our response. Our numerical results are correct and reproduce known physical phenomena, as discussed in the original article hence, as careful readers will recognise, the formalism used is canonical scattering theory, and cannot be anything other. In fact, there is no new fundamental physics here to dispute whatsoever, and nor was this the raison d'etre of the original article. Additionally, rebuttal (2) provides the opportunity to discuss, at length, some of these textbook aspects of photoionization theory, and we hope this discussion might be of service to new researchers entering this challenging field.},

As compared to atomic ionization, the time-delays expected from molecular ionization present a much richer phenomenon, with a strong spatial dependence due to the anisotropic nature of the molecular scattering potential. We investigate this from a scattering theory perspective, and make use of molecular photoionization calculations to examine this effect in representative homonuclear and hetronuclear diatomic molecules, nitrogen and carbon monoxide. We present energy and angle-resolved maps of the Wigner delay time for single-photon valence ionization, and discuss the possibilities for experimental measurements. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Subbands with odd K+ show PADs with maximum intensity along the polarization vector of the ionizing laser beam, while those with even K+ show PADs with maximum intensity perpendicular to this direction. Velocity-map images recorded at low photoelectron energies approach rotational resolution of the ion, and the evolution of the PADs with increasing rotational level prepared in the Ã Au1 state indicates the potential of a "complete" determination of the photoionization dynamics of the Ã Au1 state.

In addition, we observe the dependence of the photoelectron angular distributions on initially prepared alignment, by varying the relative polarizations of pump and probe.

  Abstract                 = {Chemical reactions are manifestations of the dynamics of molecular valence electrons and their couplings to atomic motions. Emerging methods in attosecond science can probe purely electronic dynamics in atomic and molecular systems 1-6. By contrast, time-resolved structural-dynamics methods such as electron 7-10 or X-ray diffraction 11 and X-ray absorption 12 yield complementary information about the atomic motions. Time-resolved methods that are directly sensitive to both valence-electron dynamics and atomic motions include photoelectron spectroscopy and high-harmonic generation: in both cases, this sensitivity derives from the ionization-matrix element 18,19. Here we demonstrate a time-resolved molecular-frame photoelectron-angular-distribution (TRMFPAD) method for imaging the purely valence-electron dynamics during a chemical reaction. Specifically, the TRMFPADs measured during the non-adiabatic photodissociation of carbon disulphide demonstrate how the purely electronic rearrangements of the valence electrons can be projected from inherently coupled electronic-vibrational dynamics. Combined with ongoing efforts in molecular frame alignment 20 and orientation 21,22, TRMFPADs offer the promise of directly imaging valence-electron dynamics during molecular processes without involving the use of strong, highly perturbing laser fields 23. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  Abstract                 = {Photoelectron interferograms, manifested in photoelectron angular distributions (PADs), are high-information, coherent observables. In order to obtain the maximum information from angle-resolved photoionization experiments it is desirable to record the full, three-dimensional (3D), photoelectron momentum distribution. Here we apply tomographic reconstruction techniques to obtain such 3D distributions from multiphoton ionization of potassium atoms, and fully analyze the energy and angular content of the 3D data. The PADs obtained as a function of energy indicate good agreement with previous 2D data and detailed analysis [Hockett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 223001 (2014)10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.223001] concerning the main spectral features, but also indicate unexpected symmetry breaking in certain regions of momentum space, thus revealing additional continuum interferences which cannot otherwise be observed. These observations reflect the presence of additional ionization pathways and, most generally, illustrate the power of maximum-information measurements of coherent observables for quantum metrology of complex systems. © 2015 American Physical Society. ©2015 American Physical Society. ca.},

Here we present the experimental data from recent coincidence imaging experiments, undertaken with the aim of gaining insight into the complex ultrafast excited-state dynamics of 1,3-butadiene initiated by absorption of 200 nm light. We discuss photoion and photoelectron mappings of increasing dimensionality, and focus particularly on the time-resolved photoelectron angular distributions (TRPADs), expected to be a sensitive probe of the electronic evolution of the excited state and to provide significant information beyond the time-resolved photoelectron spectrum (TRPES). Complex temporal behaviour is observed in the TRPADs, revealing their sensitivity to the dynamics while also emphasising the difficulty of interpretation of these complex observables. From the experimental data some details of the wavepacket dynamics are discerned relatively directly, and we make some tentative comparisons with existing ab initio calculations in order to gain deeper insight into the experimental measurements; finally, we sketch out some considerations for taking this comparison further in order to bridge the gap between experiment and theory. © 2013, Taylor & Francis.},

We consider the polarization sensitivity of both the instantaneous and cumulative continuum wavefunction; the nature of the coherent control over the resultant photoelectron interferogram is thus explored in detail. Based on this understanding, the use of coherent control with polarization-shaped pulses as a methodology for a highly multiplexed coherent quantum metrology is also investigated, and defined in terms of the information content of the observable. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {A new algorithm was developed to classify populations of binary (black and white) images of cloud particles collected with Particle Measuring Systems (PMS) Optical Array Probes (OAPA). The algorithm classifies images into four habit categories: 'spheres,' 'irregulars,' 'needles,' and 'dendrites.' The present algorithm derives the particle habits from an analysis of dimensionless ratios of simple geometrical measures such as the x and y dimensions, perimeter, and image area. For an ensemble of images containing a mixture of different habits, the distribution of a particular ratio will be a linear superposition of basis distributions of ratios of the individual habits. The fraction of each habit in the ensemble is found by solving the inverse problem. One of the advantages of the suggested scheme is that it provides recognition analysis of both 'complete' and 'partial' images, that is, images that are completely or partially contained within the sample area of the probe. The ability to process 'partial' images improves the statistics of the recognition by approximately 50% when compared with retrievals that use 'complete' images only. The details of this algorithm are discussed in this study.},

  Abstract                 = {The encoding of quantum information in photonic time-bin qubits is apt for long-distance quantum communication schemes. In practice, due to technical constraints such as detector response time, or the speed with which copolarized time-bins can be switched, other encodings, e.g., polarization, are often preferred for operations like state detection. Here, we present the conversion of qubits between polarization and time-bin encodings by using a method that is based on an ultrafast optical Kerr shutter and attain efficiencies of 97% and an average fidelity of 0.827$\pm$0.003 with shutter speeds near 1 ps. Our demonstration delineates an essential requirement for the development of hybrid and high-rate optical quantum networks. {\copyright} 2017 American Physical Society.},

The profiling system has a spatial resolution of a few micrometers and applications are promoted by the fact that the measurement is performed with the same pulse that undertakes ablation.

  Abstract                 = {In general, many different diagrams can contribute to the signal measured in broadband four-wave mixing experiments. Care must therefore be taken when designing an experiment to be sensitive to only the desired diagram by taking advantage of phase matching, pulse timing, sequence, and the wavelengths employed. We use sub- 25 fs pulses to create and monitor vibrational wavepackets in gaseous iodine, bromine, and iodine bromide through time- and frequency-resolved femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy. We experimentally illustrate this using iodine, where the broad bandwidths of our pulses, and Boltzmann population in the lower three vibrational levels conspire to make a single diagram dominant in one spectral region of the signal spectrum. In another spectral region, however, the signal is the sum of two almost equally contributing diagrams, making it difficult to directly extract information about the molecular dynamics. We derive simple analytical expressions for the time- and frequency-resolved CARS signal to study the interplay of different diagrams. Expressions are given for all five diagrams which can contribute to the CARS signal in our case. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Expanding the regime of observable quantum behaviour to large-scale objects is therefore an exciting open problem. In macroscopic systems of interacting particles, rapid thermalization usually destroys any quantum coherence before it can be measured or used at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate quantum processing in the vibrational modes of a macroscopic diamond sample under ambient conditions. Using ultrafast Raman scattering, we create an extended, highly non-classical state in the optical phonon modes of bulk diamond. Direct measurement of phonon coherence and correlations establishes the non-classical nature of the crystal dynamics. These results show that optical phonons in diamond provide a unique opportunity for the study of large-scale quantum behaviour, and highlight the potential for diamond as a micro-photonic quantum processor capable of operating at terahertz rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Time-resolved photoelectron imaging was used to investigate the dynamical evolution of the initially prepared S1 (ππ) excited state of phenol (hydroxybenzene), catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene), resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene), and hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene) following excitation at 267 nm. Our analysis was supported by ab initio calculations at the coupled-cluster and CASSCF levels of theory. In all cases, we observe rapid (1 ps) intramolecular vibrational redistribution on the S1 potential surface. In catechol, the overall S1 state lifetime was observed to be 12.1 ps, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude shorter than in the other three molecules studied. This may be attributed to differences in the H atom tunnelling rate under the barrier formed by a conical intersection between the S1 state and the close lying S2 (πσ) state, which is dissociative along the O-H stretching coordinate. Further evidence of this S1S2 interaction is also seen in the time-dependent anisotropy of the photoelectron angular distributions we have observed. Our data analysis was assisted by a matrix inversion method for processing photoelectron images that is significantly faster than most other previously reported approaches and is extremely quick and easy to implement. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

  Abstract                 = {The complexity of ultrafast molecular photoionization presents an obstacle to the modeling of pump-probe experiments. Here, a simple optimized model of atomic rubidium is combined with a molecular dynamics model to predict quantitatively the results of a pump-probe experiment in which long-range rubidium dimers are first excited, then ionized after a variable delay. The method is illustrated by the outline of two proposed feasible experiments and the calculation of their outcomes. Both of these proposals use Feshbach Rb872 molecules. We show that long-range molecular pump-probe experiments should observe spin-orbit precession given a suitable pump pulse, and that the associated high-frequency beat signal in the ionization probability decays after a few tens of picoseconds. If the molecule was to be excited to only a single fine-structure state, then a low-frequency oscillation in the internuclear separation would be detectable through the time-dependent ionization cross section, giving a mechanism that would enable observation of coherent vibrational motion in this molecule. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

  Abstract                 = {Calculations relating to two experiments that demonstrate coherent control of preformed rubidium-85 molecules in a magneto-optical trap using ultrafast laser pulses are presented. The two experiments are a step toward the stabilization of ultracold rubidium dimers using ultrafast lasers. In the first experiment, it is shown that preassociated molecules in an incoherent mixture of states can be made to oscillate coherently using a single ultrafast pulse. A mechanism that can transfer molecular population to more deeply bound vibrational levels is used in the second. Optimal parameters of the control pulse are presented for the application of the mechanism to molecules in a magneto-optical trap. The calculations make use of an experimental determination of the initial state of molecules photoassociated by the trapping lasers in the magneto-optical trap and use shaped pulses consistent with a standard ultrafast laser system. The experiment's purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate the use of ultrafast shaped pulses to manipulate ultracold rubidium dimers with a view to the eventual stabilization of the molecules. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

The result is a coherent optical storage device with an extremely large time bandwidth product, that functions as an array of dynamically configurable beam splitters, and that can be read out with arbitrarily high efficiency.

The novel memory interaction takes place through a far off-resonant two-photon transition in which the memory bandwidth is dynamically generated by a strong control field7,8. This should allow data rates more than 100 times greater than those of existing quantum memories. The memory works with a total efficiency of 15%, and its coherence is demonstrated through direct interference of the stored and retrieved pulses.

Combining these functions in a light-matter interface that can be integrated on-chip with other photonic quantum technologies, e.g. sources of entangled photons, is an important step towards these applications. To date there have only been a few demonstrations of coherent pulse manipulation utilizing optical storage devices compatible with quantum states, and that only in atomic gas media (making integration difficult) and with limited capabilities. Here we describe how a broadband waveguide quantum memory based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol can be used as a programmable processor for essentially arbitrary spectral and temporal manipulations of individual quantum optical pulses. Using weak coherent optical pulses at the few photon level, we experimentally demonstrate sequencing, time-to-frequency multiplexing and demultiplexing, splitting, interfering, temporal and spectral filtering, compressing and stretching as well as selective delaying. Our integrated light-matter interface offers high-rate, robust and easily configurable manipulation of quantum optical pulses and brings fully practical optical quantum devices one step closer to reality. Furthermore, as the AFC protocol is suitable for storage of intense light pulses, our processor may also find applications in classical communications. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

Mediated by an impurity-doped crystal, a signal photon in an arbitrary time-bin qubit state modulates the phase of an intense probe pulse that is stored during the interaction. Using a thulium-doped waveguide in LiNbO 3, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment with macroscopic signal pulses, demonstrating the expected cross-phase modulation as well as the ability to preserve the coherence between temporal modes. Our findings open the path to a new key component of quantum photonics based on rare-earth-ion-doped crystals. © 2016 The Author(s).},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises information-theoretically secure communication and is already on the verge of commercialization. The next step will be to implement high-dimensional protocols in order to improve noise resistance and increase the data rate. Hitherto, no experimental verification of high-dimensional QKD in the single-photon regime has been conducted outside of the laboratory. Here, we report the realization of such a single-photon QKD system in a turbulent free-space link of 0.3 km over the city of Ottawa, taking advantage of both the spin and orbital angular momentum photonic degrees of freedom. This combination of optical angular momenta allows us to create a 4-dimensional quantum state; wherein, using a high-dimensional BB84 protocol, a quantum bit error rate of 11% was attained with a corresponding secret key rate of 0.65 bits per sifted photon. In comparison, an error rate of 5% with a secret key rate of 0.43 bits per sifted photon is achieved for the case of 2-dimensional structured photons. We thus demonstrate that, even through moderate turbulence without active wavefront correction, high-dimensional photon states are advantageous for securely transmitting more information. This opens the way for intracity high-dimensional quantum communications under realistic conditions. {\copyright} 2017 Optical Society of America.},

  Abstract                 = {The generation of large multiphoton quantum states - for applications in computing, metrology and simulation - requires a network of high-efficiency quantum memories capable of storing broadband pulses. Integrating these memories into a fibre offers a number of advantages towards realizing this goal: strong light-matter coupling at low powers, simplified alignment and compatibility with existing photonic architectures. Here, we introduce a large-core kagome-structured hollow-core fibre as a suitable platform for an integrated fibre-based quantum memory with a warm atomic vapour. We demonstrate, for the first time, efficient optical pumping in such a system, where 90 ± 1% of atoms are prepared in the ground state. We measure high optical depths (3 × 104) and narrow homogeneous linewidths (6 ± 2 MHz) that do not exhibit significant transit-time broadening, showing that we can prepare a Λ-level system in a pure state. Our results establish that kagome fibres are suitable for implementing a broadband, room-temperature quantum memory, as well as a range of nonlinear optical effects. © IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

  Abstract                 = {Storing information encoded in light is critical for realizing optical buffers for all-optical signal processing and quantum memories for quantum information processing. These proposals require efficient interaction between atoms and a well-defined optical mode. Photonic crystal fibres can enhance light-matter interactions and have engendered a broad range of nonlinear effects; however, the storage of light has proven elusive. Here, we report the first demonstration of an optical memory in a hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. We store gigahertz-bandwidth light in the hyperfine coherence of caesium atoms at room temperature using a far-detuned Raman interaction. We demonstrate a signal-to-noise ratio of 2.6:1 at the single-photon level and a memory efficiency of 27 ± 1%. Our results demonstrate the potential of a room-temperature fibre-integrated optical memory for implementing local nodes of quantum information networks. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Using the NRDSE exclusively, both the electronic branching ratio and predissociation lifetime may be controlled. Infrared control pulses are used to modify the field-free dynamical evolution during traversal of the avoided crossing, thus controlling the nonadiabatic branching ratio. Predissociation lifetimes may be either increased or decreased using properly timed short infrared pulses to modify phase differences between the diabatic wave packets. In contrast with the limiting cases of perturbative control (interference between transitions) and strong field control with ionizing laser fields, control via the NRDSE may be thought of as reversibly modifying the effective Hamiltonian during system propagation. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonperturbative quantum control schemes in the intermediate field strength (nonionizing) regime are investigated. We restrict the matter-field interaction to the nonresonant dynamic Stark effect (NRDSE) as induced by infrared laser fields, which we argue is a new and general tool for quantum control of atomic and molecular dynamics. For the case of Raman coupled matter states, an effective Hamiltionian may be constructed, and quantum control via NRDSE may be thought of as reversibly modifying the effective Hamiltonian during system propagation, thus leading to control over dynamic processes. As an illustration, the creation of field-free "switched" wave packets through the adiabatic turn on and sudden turn off of the NRDSE is considered and experimentally demonstrated. Wave packets generated through the switched NRDSE interaction may be very different in form and content than wave packets generated via resonant transitions with Gaussian optical pulses. In order to provide an example, we discuss the specific case of rotational wave packet dynamics where the NRDSE manifests itself as molecular axis alignment. This technique is applied to the creation of field-free molecular axis alignment using an intense switched 1.064 μm laser pulse. This switched laser pulse was generated via a plasma shuttering technique, giving a pulse with a rise time of 150 ps and a fall time of 170 fs. The temporal evolution of the molecular axis alignment is probed via the optical Kerr effect. Field-free alignment via the switched NRDSE is demonstrated for both linear (CO2, C S2) and symmetric top (1,2-propadiene) polyatomic molecules. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},

  Abstract                 = {The absorption of broadband photons in atomic ensembles requires either an effective broadening of the atomic transition linewidth, or an off-resonance Raman interaction. Here, we propose a scheme for a quantum memory capable of storing and retrieving ultrafast photons in an ensemble of two-level atoms using a propagation medium with a time–dependent refractive index generated from aligning an ensemble of gas-phase diatomic molecules. The refractive index dynamics generates an effective longitudinal inhomogeneous broadening of the two-level transition. We numerically demonstrate this scheme for storage and retrieval of a weak pulse as short as 50 fs, with a storage time of up to 20 ps. With additional optical control of the molecular alignment dynamics, the storage time can be extended about one nanosecond leading to time–bandwidth products of order 104. This scheme could in principle be achieved using either a hollow-core fibre or a high-pressure gas cell, in a gaseous host medium comprised of diatomic molecules and a two-level atomic vapour at room temperature. © 2016, Copyright of the Crown in Canada 2016 The National Research Council of Canada.},

Specifically, we compare the use of impulsive kick laser pulses having both linear and elliptical polarization to the use of elliptically polarized switched laser pulses.

  Abstract                 = {Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular momentum components, each with an amplitude and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-wave with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-wave with a spherically symmetric s-wave provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-wave. I n the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, a particle is fully described by its complex wave function Y, which is charac-terized by both an amplitude and phase. How-ever, only the square modulus of the wave function, |Y| 2 , can be directly observed (1, 2). Re-cent developments in attosecond technology based on electron-ion recollision (3) have pro-vided experimental tools for the imaging of the electronic wave function (not its square) in bound states or ionization continua. High-harmonic spec-troscopy on aligned molecules was used to re-construct the highest-occupied molecular orbital of nitrogen (4, 5) and to observe charge migra-tion (6). Strong-field tunneling was used to mea-sure the square modulus of the highest-occupied molecular orbital for selected molecules (7). Fur-thermore, recollision holography (8, 9) permitted a measurement of the phase and amplitude of a continuum electron generated in an intense laser field. Complementary to recollision-based measure-ments, photoelectron spectroscopy with atto-second extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses has also measured photoelectron wave packets in continuum states (10--16) by exploiting quantum interferences (17--19). However, decomposition of the wave function of an ejected photoelec-tron into angular momentum eigenstates with a fully characterized amplitude and phase is more difficult. First, in general, a one-photon transition with linearly polarized light gener-ates two orbital angular momentum (') states, according to the selection rule D ' $\sfrac{1}{4}$ T1. Second, because the initial state has a {\dh}2' {\th} 1{\TH}-fold de-generacy (labeled by m, the magnetic quan-tum number) and because m is conserved for interactions with linearly polarized light, photo-electron waves with a range of m are produced. Hence, the photoelectron momentum distribution contains a sum of contributions from different initial states, each of which is a coherent sum of different angular momentum components, making it difficult to decompose the continuum state into individual angular momentum com-ponents (20--22). Here we preferentially create an almost pure f-wave continuum wave function with m = 0 in neon by using an attosecond XUV pulse train synchronized with an infrared (IR) laser pulse through the process of high-harmonic genera-tion. The isolation of the f-wave with m = 0 is attributed to the XUV excitation to a resonant bound state that is Stark-shifted by the IR field.},

  Abstract                 = {A combination of vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy is used to study the changes in morphology and conformational order in monolayers prepared from three natural sphingomyelin (SM) mixtures as a function of surface pressure and cholesterol concentration. The most homogeneous SM gave monolayers with well-ordered acyl chains and few gauche defects with relatively small effects of either increasing surface pressure or cholesterol addition. Heterogeneous SM mixtures with a mixture of acyl chain lengths or with significant fractions of unsaturated acyl chains had much larger contributions from gauche defects at low surface pressure and gave increasingly well-ordered monolayers as the surface pressure increased. They also showed substantial increases in lipid chain order after cholesterol addition. Overall, these results are consistent with the strong hydrogen bonding capacity of SM leading to well-ordered monolayers over a range of surface pressures. The changes in acyl chain order for natural SMs as a function of cholesterol are relevant to formation of sphingolipid-cholesterol enriched domains in cell membranes. © Published 2012 by the American Chemical Society.},

We generate the fs IR pulse via standard procedures and simultaneously generate an 'inverted' time-asymmetric narrowband ps visible pulse via second harmonic generation in the pump depletion regime using a very long nonlinear crystal which has high group velocity mismatch (LiNbO3). The 'inverted' ps pulse shape minimally samples the instantaneous nonresonant response but maximally samples the resonant response, maintaining high spectral resolution.

  Abstract                 = {We compare the standard 50%-efficient single beam splitter method for Bell-state measurement to a proposed 75%-efficient auxiliary-photon-enhanced scheme [W. P. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.84.042331] in light of realistic conditions. The two schemes are compared with consideration for high input state photon loss, auxiliary state photon loss, detector inefficiency and coupling loss, detector dark counts, and non-number-resolving detectors. We also analyze the two schemes when multiplexed arrays of non-number-resolving detectors are used. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of utilizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion as the auxiliary photon pair source required by the enhanced scheme. In these different cases, we determine the bounds on the detector parameters at which the enhanced scheme becomes superior to the standard scheme and describe the impact of the different imperfections on measurement success rate and discrimination fidelity. This is done using a combination of numeric and analytic techniques. For many of the cases discussed, the size of the Hilbert space and the number of measurement outcomes can be very large, which makes direct numerical solutions computationally costly. To alleviate this problem, all of our numerical computations are performed using pure states. This requires tracking the loss modes until measurement and treating dark counts as variations on measurement outcomes rather than modifications to the state itself. In addition, we provide approximate analytic expressions that illustrate the effect of different imperfections on the Bell-state analyzer quality. © 2016 American Physical Society.},

  Abstract                 = {Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) is a powerful tool for the study of intramolecular dynamics, particularly excited state non-adiabatic dynamics in polyatomic molecules. Depending on the problem at hand, different levels of TRPES measurements can be performed: time-resolved photoelectron yield; time- and energy-resolved photoelectron yield; time-, energy-, and angle-resolved photoelectron yield. In this pedagogical overview, a conceptual framework for time-resolved photoionization measurements is presented, together with discussion of relevant theory for the different aspects of TRPES. Simple models are used to illustrate the theory, and key concepts are further amplified by experimental examples. These examples are chosen to show the application of TRPES to the investigation of a range of problems in the excited state dynamics of molecules: from the simplest vibrational wavepacket on a single potential energy surface; to disentangling intrinsically coupled electronic and nuclear motions; to identifying the electronic character of the intermediate states involved in non-adiabatic dynamics by angle-resolved measurements in the molecular frame, the most complete measurement. © 2011 the Owner Societies.},

  Abstract                 = {There are both fundamental and practical motivations for studying whether quantum entanglement can exist in macroscopic systems. However, multiparty entanglement is generally fragile and difficult to quantify. Dicke states are multiparty entangled states where a single excitation is delocalized over many systems. Building on previous work on quantum memories for photons, we create a Dicke state in a solid by storing a single photon in a crystal that contains many large atomic ensembles with distinct resonance frequencies. The photon is re-emitted at a well-defined time due to an interference effect analogous to multi-slit diffraction. We derive a lower bound for the number of entangled ensembles based on the contrast of the interference and the single-photon character of the input, and we experimentally demonstrate entanglement between over two hundred ensembles, each containing a billion atoms. We also illustrate the fact that each individual ensemble contains further entanglement. {\copyright} 2017 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {At the fundamental level, quantum communication is ultimately limited by noise. For instance, quantum signals cannot be amplified without the introduction of noise in the amplified states. Furthermore, photon loss reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, accentuating the effect of noise. Thus, most of the efforts in quantum communications have been directed towards overcoming noise to achieve longer communication distances, larger secret key rates, or to operate in noisier environmental conditions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a platform for quantum communication based on ultrafast optical techniques. In particular, our scheme enables the experimental realization of high rates and quantum signal filtering approaching a single spectrotemporal mode, resulting in a dramatic reduction in channel noise. By experimentally realizing a 1-ps optically induced temporal gate, we show that ultrafast time filtering can result in an improvement in noise tolerance by a factor of up to 1200 compared to a 2-ns electronic filter, enabling daytime quantum key distribution or quantum communication in bright fibers.},

  abstract = {The photonic temporal degree of freedom is one of the most promising platforms for quantum communication over fiber networks and free-space channels. In particular, time-bin states of photons are robust to environmental disturbances, support high-rate communication, and can be used in high-dimensional schemes. However, the detection of photonic time-bin states remains a challenging task, particularly for the case of photons that are in a superposition of different time-bins. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of picosecond time-bin states of light, known as ultrafast time-bins, for applications in quantum communications. With the ability to measure time-bin superpositions with excellent phase stability, we enable the use of temporal states in efficient quantum key distribution protocols such as the BB84 protocol.},

This setup allows us to take, within seconds, spectral temporal correlation measurements on entangled photon sources with sub-nanometer spectral resolution and nanosecond timing resolution. Through post processing, we can observe the HOM behaviour for any number of spectral filters of any shape and width at any wavelength over the observable spectral range. Our setup also offers great versatility in that it is capable of operating at a wide spectral range from the visible to the near infrared and does not require a pulsed pump laser for timing purposes. This work offers the ability to gain large amounts of spectral and temporal information from a HOM interferometer quickly and efficiently and will be a very useful tool for many quantum technology applications and fundamental quantum optics research.},

  abstract = {To capture the 3D information of a scene, conventional techniques often require multiple 2D images of the scene to be captured from different perspectives. In this work we demonstrate the reconstruction of a scene's 3D information through ray-tracing using quantum correlated photon pairs. By capturing the two photons in different image planes using time-tagging cameras and taking advantage of the position, momentum and time correlation of the photons, the photons' propagation trajectory can be reconstructed. With this information on every photon pair, we were able to demonstrate refocusing, depth of field adjustment and parallax visualization of a 3D scene. With future camera advancements, this technique could achieve a much higher momentum resolution than conventional techniques thus giving larger depth of field and more viewing angles. The high photon correlation and low photon flux from a quantum source also makes the technique well suited for 3D imaging of light sensitive samples.},

  abstract      = {Molecular frame high-harmonic spectra of aligned N 2 molecules reveal a Cooper-like minimum. By deconvolving the laboratory frame alignment distribution, what was previously thought to be a maximum of emission along the molecular axis is found to be maxima at 35 degrees off axis, with a spectral minimum on axis. Both of these features are supported by photoionization calculations that underline the relationship between high-harmonic spectroscopy and photoionization measurements. The calculations reveal that the on axis spectral minimum is a Cooper-like minimum that arises from the destructive interference of the p and f partial wave contributions to high-harmonic photorecombination. Features such as Cooper minima and shape resonances are ubiquitous in molecular photoionization or recombination. Published by the American Physical Society.

  Abstract                 = {The application of nonresonant lasers to quantum systems can modify energy levels in a general way. This approach, using the nonresonant dynamic Stark effect, is an effective mechanism for modifying chemical dynamics. These molecular techniques have analogous implementations in quantum technologies. Applications include controlling vacuum fluctuations to create molecular alignment and broadband light sources, photonic catalysis, quantum memories in atomic vapours, and photonics in bulk diamond phonons. The links between these different applications are investigated. Â© 2011 IEEE.},

We introduce a quantum random number generator based on the phase measurement of Stokes light generated by amplification of zero-point vacuum fluctuations using stimulated Raman scattering. This is an example of quantum noise amplification using the most noise-free process possible: near unitary quantum evolution. The use of phase offers robustness to classical pump noise and the ability to generate multiple bits per measurement. The Stokes light is generated with high intensity and as a result, fast detectors with high signal-to-noise ratios can be used for measurement, eliminating the need for single-photon sensitive devices. The demonstrated implementation uses optical phonons in bulk diamond. Â© 2011 Optical Society of America.},

Interference requires that the multiple pathways through an interferometer be temporally indistinguishable to within the coherence time of the photon. In this Letter, we use a diamond quantum memory to demonstrate interference between quantum pathways, initially temporally separated by many multiples of the optical coherence time. The quantum memory can be viewed as a light-matter beam splitter, mapping a THz-bandwidth single photon to a variable superposition of the output optical mode and stored phononic mode. Because the memory acts both as a beam splitter and as a buffer, the relevant coherence time for interference is not that of the photon, but rather that of the memory. We use this mechanism to demonstrate nonclassical single-photon and two-photon interference between quantum pathways initially separated by several picoseconds, even though the duration of the photons themselves is just âˆ¼250 fs.

The THz-bandwidth heralded photons are generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and mapped to phonons via a Raman transition, stored for a variable delay, and released on demand. The second-order correlation of the memory output is g(2)(0)=0.65Â±0.07, demonstrating a preservation of nonclassical photon statistics throughout storage and retrieval. The memory is low noise, high speed and broadly tunable; it therefore promises to be a versatile light-matter interface for local quantum processing applications. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.},

At longer storage times, the process fidelity remains high, despite a loss of efficiency. The fidelity is 86 Â± 4% for 1.5 Î¼s storage time, which is 5000 times the pulse duration. Hence, high fidelity is combined with a large time-bandwidth product.

  abstract      = {Photon pair sources have wide ranging applications in a variety of quantum photonic experiments and protocols. Many of these protocols require well controlled spectral correlations between the two output photons. However, due to low cross-sections, measuring the joint spectral properties of photon pair sources has historically been a challenging and time-consuming task. Here, we present an approach for the real-time measurement of the joint spectral properties of a fiber-based four wave mixing source. We seed the four wave mixing process using a broadband chirped pulse, studying the stimulated process to extract information regarding the spontaneous process. In addition, we compare stimulated emission measurements with the spontaneous process to confirm the technique{\textquoteright}s validity. Joint spectral measurements have taken many hours historically and several minutes with recent techniques. Here, measurements have been demonstrated in 5--30 s depending on resolution, offering substantial improvement. Additional benefits of this approach include flexible resolution, large measurement bandwidth, and reduced experimental overhead. {\copyright} 2018 Optical Society of America.},

Here we demonstrate a diamond quantum memory that stores, and releases on demand, an arbitrarily polarized $\sim$250 fs duration photonic qubit. The single-mode nature of the memory is overcome by mapping the two degrees of polarization of the qubit, via Raman transitions, onto two spatially distinct optical phonon modes located in the same diamond crystal. The two modes are coherently recombined upon retrieval and quantum process tomography confirms that the memory faithfully reproduces the input state with average fidelity 0.784$\pm$0.004 with a total memory efficiency of (0.76$\pm$0.03)%. In an additional demonstration, one photon of a polarization-entangled pair is stored in the memory. We report that entanglement persists in the retrieved state for up to 1.3 ps of storage time. These results demonstrate that the diamond phonon platform can be used in concert with polarization qubits, a key requirement for polarization-encoded photonic processing. {\copyright} 2017 American Physical Society.},

Large frequency shifts are needed for conversion between optical and telecommunication frequencies, while smaller shifts are useful for frequency-multiplexing quantum systems, in the same way that wavelength division multiplexing is used in classical communications. Here we demonstrate frequency and bandwidth conversion of single photons in a room-temperature diamond quantum memory. Heralded 723.5 nm photons, with 4.1 nm bandwidth, are stored as optical phonons in the diamond via a Raman transition. Upon retrieval from the diamond memory, the spectral shape of the photons is determined by a tunable read pulse through the reverse Raman transition. We report central frequency tunability over 4.2 times the input bandwidth, and bandwidth modulation between 0.5 and 1.9 times the input bandwidth. Our results demonstrate the potential for diamond, and Raman memories in general, as an integrated platform for photon storage and spectral conversion.},

Additionally, analysis of the full photoelectron image stack provides a quantum beat imaging modality, in which the Fourier components of the photoelectron images correlated with specific beat components can be obtained. This may also permit the extraction of isotope-resolved photoelectron images in the frequency domain, in cases where nuclear spins (hence beat components) can be uniquely assigned to specific isotopes (as herein), and also provides phase information. The information content of both raw, and inverted, image stacks is investigated, suggesting the utility of the Fourier analysis methodology in cases where images cannot be inverted.},

This phase difference has an impact on harmonics from aligned polar molecules, suppressing emission from the molecules parallel to the driving laser field while favoring the perpendicular ones. For oriented molecules, we measure the amplitude ratio of even to odd harmonics produced when intense light irradiates CO molecules and determine the degree of orientation and the phase difference of attosecond bursts using molecular frame ionization and recombination amplitudes. The sensitivity of the high harmonic spectrum to subtle phase differences in the emitted radiation makes it a detailed probe of polar molecules and will drive major advances in the theory of high harmonic generation.

  Abstract                 = {Quantum lightâ€“matter interfaces are at the heart of photonic quantum technologies. Quantum memories for photons, where non-classical states of photons are mapped onto stationary matter states and preserved for subsequent retrieval, are technical realizations enabled by exquisite control over interactions between light and matter. The ability of quantum memories to synchronize probabilistic events makes them a key component in quantum repeaters and quantum computation based on linear optics. This critical feature has motivated many groups to dedicate theoretical and experimental research to develop quantum memory devices. In recent years, exciting new applications, and more advanced developments of quantum memories, have proliferated. In this review, we outline some of the emerging applications of quantum memories in optical signal processing, quantum computation and non-linear optics. We review recent experimental and theoretical developments, and their impacts on more advanced photonic quantum technologies based on quantum memories. Ã‚Â© 2016 The Author(s).

  Abstract                 = {Single and multi-photon ionization of aligned molecular ensembles is examined, with a particular focus on the link between the molecular axis distribution and observable in various angle-integrated and angle-resolved measurements. To maintain generality the problem is treated geometrically, with the aligned ensemble cast in terms of axis distribution moments, and the response of observables in terms of couplings to these moments. Within this formalism the angular momentum coupling is treated analytically, allowing for general characteristics - independent of the details of the ionization dynamics of a specific molecule - to be determined. Limiting cases are explored in order to provide a phenomenology which should be readily applicable to a range of experimental measurements, and illustrate how observables can be sensitive to fine details of the alignment, i.e. higher-order moments of the axis distribution, which are often neglected in experimental studies. We hope that this detailed and comprehensive treatment will bridge the gap between existing theoretical and experimental works, and provide both quantitative physical insights and a useful general phenomenology for researchers working with aligned molecular ensembles.

In a short response, Response to Comment on "Time delays in molecular photoionization" [3], we have already provided a clear rebuttal of the comment, but gave no technical details. In this fuller response we extend those brief comments in the spirit of completeness and clarity, and provide three clear rebuttals to Baykusheva {\&} W$\backslash$"orner based on (1) logical fallacy (category error), (2) theoretical details of the original article, (3) textural content of the original article. In particular, rebuttal (1) clearly and trivially points to the fact that there is no issue here whatsoever, with recourse to theoretical details barely required to demonstrate this, as outlined in the short version of our response. Our numerical results are correct and reproduce known physical phenomena, as discussed in the original article hence, as careful readers will recognise, the formalism used is canonical scattering theory, and cannot be anything other. In fact, there is no new fundamental physics here to dispute whatsoever, and nor was this the raison d'etre of the original article. Additionally, rebuttal (2) provides the opportunity to discuss, at length, some of these textbook aspects of photoionization theory, and we hope this discussion might be of service to new researchers entering this challenging field.},

  Abstract                 = {Time-delays in the photoionization of molecules are investigated. As compared to atomic ionization, the time-delays expected from molecular ionization present a much richer phenomenon, with a strong spatial dependence due to the anisotropic nature of the molecular scattering potential. We investigate this from a scattering theory perspective, and make use of molecular photoionization calculations to examine this effect in representative homonuclear and hetronuclear diatomic molecules, nitrogen and carbon monoxide. We present energy and angle-resolved maps of the Wigner delay time for single-photon valence ionization, and discuss the possibilities for experimental measurements. Â© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Angle-resolved photoelectron spectra from rotationally selected Ãƒ Au1 state acetylene have been recorded using velocity-map imaging. Several Renner-Teller split vibrational bands have been observed and assigned, showing good agreement with previous zero kinetic energy photoelectron (ZEKE) work [S. T. Pratt, P. M. Dehmer, and J. L. Dehmer, J. Chem. Phys. 99, 6233 (1993); S.-J. Tang, Y.-C. Chou, J. J.-M. Lin, and Y.-C. Hsu, ibid. 125, 133201 (2006).] The extracted photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) corresponding to these bands show a strong dependence on the vibronic angular momentum projection quantum number K+. Subbands with odd K+ show PADs with maximum intensity along the polarization vector of the ionizing laser beam, while those with even K+ show PADs with maximum intensity perpendicular to this direction. Velocity-map images recorded at low photoelectron energies approach rotational resolution of the ion, and the evolution of the PADs with increasing rotational level prepared in the Ãƒ Au1 state indicates the potential of a "complete" determination of the photoionization dynamics of the Ãƒ Au1 state.

In addition, we observe the dependence of the photoelectron angular distributions on initially prepared alignment, by varying the relative polarizations of pump and probe.

Emerging methods in attosecond science can probe purely electronic dynamics in atomic and molecular systems 1-6. By contrast, time-resolved structural-dynamics methods such as electron 7-10 or X-ray diffraction 11 and X-ray absorption 12 yield complementary information about the atomic motions. Time-resolved methods that are directly sensitive to both valence-electron dynamics and atomic motions include photoelectron spectroscopy and high-harmonic generation: in both cases, this sensitivity derives from the ionization-matrix element 18,19. Here we demonstrate a time-resolved molecular-frame photoelectron-angular-distribution (TRMFPAD) method for imaging the purely valence-electron dynamics during a chemical reaction. Specifically, the TRMFPADs measured during the non-adiabatic photodissociation of carbon disulphide demonstrate how the purely electronic rearrangements of the valence electrons can be projected from inherently coupled electronic-vibrational dynamics. Combined with ongoing efforts in molecular frame alignment 20 and orientation 21,22, TRMFPADs offer the promise of directly imaging valence-electron dynamics during molecular processes without involving the use of strong, highly perturbing laser fields 23.

We discuss photoion and photoelectron mappings of increasing dimensionality, and focus particularly on the time-resolved photoelectron angular distributions (TRPADs), expected to be a sensitive probe of the electronic evolution of the excited state and to provide significant information beyond the time-resolved photoelectron spectrum (TRPES). Complex temporal behaviour is observed in the TRPADs, revealing their sensitivity to the dynamics while also emphasising the difficulty of interpretation of these complex observables. From the experimental data some details of the wavepacket dynamics are discerned relatively directly, and we make some tentative comparisons with existing ab initio calculations in order to gain deeper insight into the experimental measurements; finally, we sketch out some considerations for taking this comparison further in order to bridge the gap between experiment and theory.

We consider the polarization sensitivity of both the instantaneous and cumulative continuum wavefunction; the nature of the coherent control over the resultant photoelectron interferogram is thus explored in detail. Based on this understanding, the use of coherent control with polarization-shaped pulses as a methodology for a highly multiplexed coherent quantum metrology is also investigated, and defined in terms of the information content of the observable.

We present a polaritonic description for this type of storage, which shares some similarities with electromagnetically induced transparency based quantum memories. On the other hand the proposed memory is also linked to the gradient echo memory due to the effective spatial gradient that pulses experience in the medium.

The strong interaction between excitons in levels with high principal quantum numbers prevents the creation of more than one exciton in a small crystal; resulting in the Rydberg blockade effect. Here, we propose a new kind of solid-state single-photon source based on the recently observed Rydberg blockade effect for excitons in cuprous oxide. Our quantitative estimates based on single and double excitation probability dynamics indicate that GHz rates and values of the second-order correlation function g2 (0) below the percent level can be simultaneously achievable. These results should pave the way to explore applications of Rydberg excitons in photonic quantum information processing.},

  Abstract                 = {A new algorithm was developed to classify populations of binary (black and white) images of cloud particles collected with Particle Measuring Systems (PMS) Optical Array Probes (OAPA). The algorithm classifies images into four habit categories: 'spheres,' 'irregulars,' 'needles,' and 'dendrites.' The present algorithm derives the particle habits from an analysis of dimensionless ratios of simple geometrical measures such as the x and y dimensions, perimeter, and image area. For an ensemble of images containing a mixture of different habits, the distribution of a particular ratio will be a linear superposition of basis distributions of ratios of the individual habits. The fraction of each habit in the ensemble is found by solving the inverse problem. One of the advantages of the suggested scheme is that it provides recognition analysis of both 'complete' and 'partial' images, that is, images that are completely or partially contained within the sample area of the probe. The ability to process 'partial' images improves the statistics of the recognition by approximately 50% when compared with retrievals that use 'complete' images only. The details of this algorithm are discussed in this study.},

Here, we present the conversion of qubits between polarization and time-bin encodings by using a method that is based on an ultrafast optical Kerr shutter and attain efficiencies of 97% and an average fidelity of 0.827$\pm$0.003 with shutter speeds near 1 ps.

Care must therefore be taken when designing an experiment to be sensitive to only the desired diagram by taking advantage of phase matching, pulse timing, sequence, and the wavelengths employed. We use sub- 25 fs pulses to create and monitor vibrational wavepackets in gaseous iodine, bromine, and iodine bromide through time- and frequency-resolved femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy. We experimentally illustrate this using iodine, where the broad bandwidths of our pulses, and Boltzmann population in the lower three vibrational levels conspire to make a single diagram dominant in one spectral region of the signal spectrum. In another spectral region, however, the signal is the sum of two almost equally contributing diagrams, making it difficult to directly extract information about the molecular dynamics. We derive simple analytical expressions for the time- and frequency-resolved CARS signal to study the interplay of different diagrams. Expressions are given for all five diagrams which can contribute to the CARS signal in our case. Â© 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract      = {The nature of the transition between the familiar classical, macroscopic world and the quantum, microscopic one continues to be poorly understood. Expanding the regime of observable quantum behaviour to large-scale objects is therefore an exciting open problem. In macroscopic systems of interacting particles, rapid thermalization usually destroys any quantum coherence before it can be measured or used at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate quantum processing in the vibrational modes of a macroscopic diamond sample under ambient conditions. Using ultrafast Raman scattering, we create an extended, highly non-classical state in the optical phonon modes of bulk diamond. Direct measurement of phonon coherence and correlations establishes the non-classical nature of the crystal dynamics. These results show that optical phonons in diamond provide a unique opportunity for the study of large-scale quantum behaviour, and highlight the potential for diamond as a micro-photonic quantum processor capable of operating at terahertz rates.},

We generated motional entanglement between vibrational states of two spatially separated, millimeter-sized diamonds at room temperature. By measuring strong nonclassical correlations between Raman-scattered photons, we showed that the quantum state of the diamonds has positive concurrence with 98% probability.

  abstract      = {Time-resolved photoelectron imaging was used to investigate the dynamical evolution of the initially prepared S1 (Ï€Ï€) excited state of phenol (hydroxybenzene), catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene), resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene), and hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene) following excitation at 267 nm. Our analysis was supported by ab initio calculations at the coupled-cluster and CASSCF levels of theory. In all cases, we observe rapid (1 ps) intramolecular vibrational redistribution on the S1 potential surface. In catechol, the overall S1 state lifetime was observed to be 12.1 ps, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude shorter than in the other three molecules studied. This may be attributed to differences in the H atom tunnelling rate under the barrier formed by a conical intersection between the S1 state and the close lying S2 (Ï€Ïƒ) state, which is dissociative along the O-H stretching coordinate. Further evidence of this S1S2 interaction is also seen in the time-dependent anisotropy of the photoelectron angular distributions we have observed. Our data analysis was assisted by a matrix inversion method for processing photoelectron images that is significantly faster than most other previously reported approaches and is extremely quick and easy to implement.

  Abstract                 = {The complexity of ultrafast molecular photoionization presents an obstacle to the modeling of pump-probe experiments. Here, a simple optimized model of atomic rubidium is combined with a molecular dynamics model to predict quantitatively the results of a pump-probe experiment in which long-range rubidium dimers are first excited, then ionized after a variable delay. The method is illustrated by the outline of two proposed feasible experiments and the calculation of their outcomes. Both of these proposals use Feshbach Rb872 molecules. We show that long-range molecular pump-probe experiments should observe spin-orbit precession given a suitable pump pulse, and that the associated high-frequency beat signal in the ionization probability decays after a few tens of picoseconds. If the molecule was to be excited to only a single fine-structure state, then a low-frequency oscillation in the internuclear separation would be detectable through the time-dependent ionization cross section, giving a mechanism that would enable observation of coherent vibrational motion in this molecule.

  Abstract                 = {Calculations relating to two experiments that demonstrate coherent control of preformed rubidium-85 molecules in a magneto-optical trap using ultrafast laser pulses are presented. The two experiments are a step toward the stabilization of ultracold rubidium dimers using ultrafast lasers. In the first experiment, it is shown that preassociated molecules in an incoherent mixture of states can be made to oscillate coherently using a single ultrafast pulse. A mechanism that can transfer molecular population to more deeply bound vibrational levels is used in the second. Optimal parameters of the control pulse are presented for the application of the mechanism to molecules in a magneto-optical trap. The calculations make use of an experimental determination of the initial state of molecules photoassociated by the trapping lasers in the magneto-optical trap and use shaped pulses consistent with a standard ultrafast laser system. The experiment's purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate the use of ultrafast shaped pulses to manipulate ultracold rubidium dimers with a view to the eventual stabilization of the molecules.

Dipole transitions similar to those of the atoms are observed in the molecular signal. While such behaviour is characteristic of the long-range molecules, the photoassociation of bound molecules is confirmed in additional experiments. The pump-probe signal observed on a 250 ps time scale did not, however, reveal wavepacket oscillations predicted by theory. This result is discussed using numerical simulations of photoassociation and a modification to the current experiments that could lead to the detection of wavepacket dynamics is suggested.

The novel memory interaction takes place through a far off-resonant two-photon transition in which the memory bandwidth is dynamically generated by a strong control field7,8. This should allow data rates more than 100 times greater than those of existing quantum memories. The memory works with a total efficiency of 15%, and its coherence is demonstrated through direct interference of the stored and retrieved pulses.

  Abstract                 = {Faithful storage and coherent manipulation of quantum optical pulses are key for long distance quantum communications and quantum computing. Combining these functions in a light-matter interface that can be integrated on-chip with other photonic quantum technologies, e.g. sources of entangled photons, is an important step towards these applications. To date there have only been a few demonstrations of coherent pulse manipulation utilizing optical storage devices compatible with quantum states, and that only in atomic gas media (making integration difficult) and with limited capabilities. Here we describe how a broadband waveguide quantum memory based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol can be used as a programmable processor for essentially arbitrary spectral and temporal manipulations of individual quantum optical pulses. Using weak coherent optical pulses at the few photon level, we experimentally demonstrate sequencing, time-to-frequency multiplexing and demultiplexing, splitting, interfering, temporal and spectral filtering, compressing and stretching as well as selective delaying. Our integrated light-matter interface offers high-rate, robust and easily configurable manipulation of quantum optical pulses and brings fully practical optical quantum devices one step closer to reality. Furthermore, as the AFC protocol is suitable for storage of intense light pulses, our processor may also find applications in classical communications.

  Abstract                 = {Non-destructive detection of photonic qubits is an enabling technology for quantum information processing and quantum communication. For practical applications, such as quantum repeaters and networks, it is desirable to implement such detection in a way that allows some form of multiplexing as well as easy integration with other components such as solid-state quantum memories. Here, we propose an approach to non-destructive photonic qubit detection that promises to have all the mentioned features. Mediated by an impurity-doped crystal, a signal photon in an arbitrary time-bin qubit state modulates the phase of an intense probe pulse that is stored during the interaction. Using a thulium-doped waveguide in LiNbO 3, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment with macroscopic signal pulses, demonstrating the expected cross-phase modulation as well as the ability to preserve the coherence between temporal modes. Our findings open the path to a new key component of quantum photonics based on rare-earth-ion-doped crystals. Â© 2016 The Author(s).},

  abstract        = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises information-theoretically secure communication and is already on the verge of commercialization. The next step will be to implement high-dimensional protocols in order to improve noise resistance and increase the data rate. Hitherto, no experimental verification of high-dimensional QKD in the single-photon regime has been conducted outside of the laboratory. Here, we report the realization of such a single-photon QKD system in a turbulent free-space link of 0.3 km over the city of Ottawa, taking advantage of both the spin and orbital angular momentum photonic degrees of freedom. This combination of optical angular momenta allows us to create a 4-dimensional quantum state; wherein, using a high-dimensional BB84 protocol, a quantum bit error rate of 11% was attained with a corresponding secret key rate of 0.65 bits per sifted photon. In comparison, an error rate of 5% with a secret key rate of 0.43 bits per sifted photon is achieved for the case of 2-dimensional structured photons. We thus demonstrate that, even through moderate turbulence without active wavefront correction, high-dimensional photon states are advantageous for securely transmitting more information. This opens the way for intracity high-dimensional quantum communications under realistic conditions. {\copyright} 2017 Optical Society of America.},

  abstract      = {The generation of large multiphoton quantum states - for applications in computing, metrology and simulation - requires a network of high-efficiency quantum memories capable of storing broadband pulses. Integrating these memories into a fibre offers a number of advantages towards realizing this goal: strong light-matter coupling at low powers, simplified alignment and compatibility with existing photonic architectures. Here, we introduce a large-core kagome-structured hollow-core fibre as a suitable platform for an integrated fibre-based quantum memory with a warm atomic vapour. We demonstrate, for the first time, efficient optical pumping in such a system, where 90 Â± 1% of atoms are prepared in the ground state. We measure high optical depths (3 Ã— 104) and narrow homogeneous linewidths (6 Â± 2 MHz) that do not exhibit significant transit-time broadening, showing that we can prepare a Î›-level system in a pure state. Our results establish that kagome fibres are suitable for implementing a broadband, room-temperature quantum memory, as well as a range of nonlinear optical effects.

The dynamic Stark effect due to nonresonant laser fields is used in a myriad of contemporary experiments to hold and align molecules, to shape potential energy surfaces, and to make rapid transient birefringence.

  abstract      = {Nonperturbative quantum control schemes in the intermediate field strength (nonionizing) regime are investigated. We restrict the matter-field interaction to the nonresonant dynamic Stark effect (NRDSE) as induced by infrared laser fields, which we argue is a new and general tool for quantum control of atomic and molecular dynamics. For the case of Raman coupled matter states, an effective Hamiltionian may be constructed, and quantum control via NRDSE may be thought of as reversibly modifying the effective Hamiltonian during system propagation, thus leading to control over dynamic processes. As an illustration, the creation of field-free "switched" wave packets through the adiabatic turn on and sudden turn off of the NRDSE is considered and experimentally demonstrated. Wave packets generated through the switched NRDSE interaction may be very different in form and content than wave packets generated via resonant transitions with Gaussian optical pulses. In order to provide an example, we discuss the specific case of rotational wave packet dynamics where the NRDSE manifests itself as molecular axis alignment. This technique is applied to the creation of field-free molecular axis alignment using an intense switched 1.064 Î¼m laser pulse. This switched laser pulse was generated via a plasma shuttering technique, giving a pulse with a rise time of 150 ps and a fall time of 170 fs.

  Abstract                 = {The absorption of broadband photons in atomic ensembles requires either an effective broadening of the atomic transition linewidth, or an off-resonance Raman interaction. Here, we propose a scheme for a quantum memory capable of storing and retrieving ultrafast photons in an ensemble of two-level atoms using a propagation medium with a timeâ€“dependent refractive index generated from aligning an ensemble of gas-phase diatomic molecules. The refractive index dynamics generates an effective longitudinal inhomogeneous broadening of the two-level transition. We numerically demonstrate this scheme for storage and retrieval of a weak pulse as short as 50Â fs, with a storage time of up to 20Â ps. With additional optical control of the molecular alignment dynamics, the storage time can be extended about one nanosecond leading to timeâ€“bandwidth products of order 104. This scheme could in principle be achieved using either a hollow-core fibre or a high-pressure gas cell, in a gaseous host medium comprised of diatomic molecules and a two-level atomic vapour at room temperature.

Specifically, we compare the use of impulsive kick laser pulses having both linear and elliptical polarization to the use of elliptically polarized switched laser pulses.

  abstract  = {Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular momentum components, each with an amplitude and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-wave with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-wave with a spherically symmetric s-wave provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-wave. I n the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, a particle is fully described by its complex wave function Y, which is charac-terized by both an amplitude and phase. How-ever, only the square modulus of the wave function, |Y| 2 , can be directly observed (1, 2). Re-cent developments in attosecond technology based on electron-ion recollision (3) have pro-vided experimental tools for the imaging of the electronic wave function (not its square) in bound states or ionization continua. High-harmonic spec-troscopy on aligned molecules was used to re-construct the highest-occupied molecular orbital of nitrogen (4, 5) and to observe charge migra-tion (6). Strong-field tunneling was used to mea-sure the square modulus of the highest-occupied molecular orbital for selected molecules (7). Fur-thermore, recollision holography (8, 9) permitted a measurement of the phase and amplitude of a continuum electron generated in an intense laser field. Complementary to recollision-based measure-ments, photoelectron spectroscopy with atto-second extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses has also measured photoelectron wave packets in continuum states (10--16) by exploiting quantum interferences (17--19). However, decomposition of the wave function of an ejected photoelec-tron into angular momentum eigenstates with a fully characterized amplitude and phase is more difficult. First, in general, a one-photon transition with linearly polarized light gener-ates two orbital angular momentum (') states, according to the selection rule D ' $\sfrac{1}{4}$ T1. Second, because the initial state has a {\dh}2' {\th} 1{\TH}-fold de-generacy (labeled by m, the magnetic quan-tum number) and because m is conserved for interactions with linearly polarized light, photo-electron waves with a range of m are produced. Hence, the photoelectron momentum distribution contains a sum of contributions from different initial states, each of which is a coherent sum of different angular momentum components, making it difficult to decompose the continuum state into individual angular momentum com-ponents (20--22). Here we preferentially create an almost pure f-wave continuum wave function with m = 0 in neon by using an attosecond XUV pulse train synchronized with an infrared (IR) laser pulse through the process of high-harmonic genera-tion. The isolation of the f-wave with m = 0 is attributed to the XUV excitation to a resonant bound state that is Stark-shifted by the IR field.},

  Abstract                 = {A combination of vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy is used to study the changes in morphology and conformational order in monolayers prepared from three natural sphingomyelin (SM) mixtures as a function of surface pressure and cholesterol concentration. The most homogeneous SM gave monolayers with well-ordered acyl chains and few gauche defects with relatively small effects of either increasing surface pressure or cholesterol addition. Heterogeneous SM mixtures with a mixture of acyl chain lengths or with significant fractions of unsaturated acyl chains had much larger contributions from gauche defects at low surface pressure and gave increasingly well-ordered monolayers as the surface pressure increased. They also showed substantial increases in lipid chain order after cholesterol addition. Overall, these results are consistent with the strong hydrogen bonding capacity of SM leading to well-ordered monolayers over a range of surface pressures. The changes in acyl chain order for natural SMs as a function of cholesterol are relevant to formation of sphingolipid-cholesterol enriched domains in cell membranes.

  Abstract                 = {We compare the standard 50%-efficient single beam splitter method for Bell-state measurement to a proposed 75%-efficient auxiliary-photon-enhanced scheme [W. P. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.84.042331] in light of realistic conditions. The two schemes are compared with consideration for high input state photon loss, auxiliary state photon loss, detector inefficiency and coupling loss, detector dark counts, and non-number-resolving detectors. We also analyze the two schemes when multiplexed arrays of non-number-resolving detectors are used. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of utilizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion as the auxiliary photon pair source required by the enhanced scheme. In these different cases, we determine the bounds on the detector parameters at which the enhanced scheme becomes superior to the standard scheme and describe the impact of the different imperfections on measurement success rate and discrimination fidelity. This is done using a combination of numeric and analytic techniques. For many of the cases discussed, the size of the Hilbert space and the number of measurement outcomes can be very large, which makes direct numerical solutions computationally costly. To alleviate this problem, all of our numerical computations are performed using pure states. This requires tracking the loss modes until measurement and treating dark counts as variations on measurement outcomes rather than modifications to the state itself. In addition, we provide approximate analytic expressions that illustrate the effect of different imperfections on the Bell-state analyzer quality. Â© 2016 American Physical Society.},

Depending on the problem at hand, different levels of TRPES measurements can be performed: time-resolved photoelectron yield; time- and energy-resolved photoelectron yield; time-, energy-, and angle-resolved photoelectron yield. In this pedagogical overview, a conceptual framework for time-resolved photoionization measurements is presented, together with discussion of relevant theory for the different aspects of TRPES. Simple models are used to illustrate the theory, and key concepts are further amplified by experimental examples. These examples are chosen to show the application of TRPES to the investigation of a range of problems in the excited state dynamics of molecules: from the simplest vibrational wavepacket on a single potential energy surface; to disentangling intrinsically coupled electronic and nuclear motions; to identifying the electronic character of the intermediate states involved in non-adiabatic dynamics by angle-resolved measurements in the molecular frame, the most complete measurement.

  abstract      = {There are both fundamental and practical motivations for studying whether quantum entanglement can exist in macroscopic systems. However, multiparty entanglement is generally fragile and difficult to quantify. Dicke states are multiparty entangled states where a single excitation is delocalized over many systems. Building on previous work on quantum memories for photons, we create a Dicke state in a solid by storing a single photon in a crystal that contains many large atomic ensembles with distinct resonance frequencies. The photon is re-emitted at a well-defined time due to an interference effect analogous to multi-slit diffraction. We derive a lower bound for the number of entangled ensembles based on the contrast of the interference and the single-photon character of the input, and we experimentally demonstrate entanglement between over two hundred ensembles, each containing a billion atoms. We also illustrate the fact that each individual ensemble contains further entanglement. {\copyright} 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract = {A fully homomorphic encryption system hides data from unauthorized parties, while still allowing them to perform computations on the encrypted data. Aside from the straightforward benefit of allowing users to delegate computations to a more powerful server without revealing their inputs, a fully homomorphic cryptosystem can be used as a building block in the construction of a number of cryptographic functionalities. Designing such a scheme remained an open problem until 2009, decades after the idea was first conceived, and the past few years have seen the generalization of this functionality to the world of quantum machines. Quantum schemes prior to the one implemented here were able to replicate some features in particular use-cases often associated with homomorphic encryption but lacked other crucial properties, for example, relying on continual interaction to perform a computation or leaking information about the encrypted data. We present the first experimental realisation of a quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme. We further present a toy two-party secure computation task enabled by our scheme. Finally, as part of our implementation, we also demonstrate a post-selective two-qubit linear optical controlled-phase gate with a much higher post-selection success probability (1/2) when compared to alternate implementations, e.g. with post-selective controlled-$Z$ or controlled-$X$ gates (1/9).},

abstract = {The de Broglie-Bohm theory is a hidden-variable interpretation of quantum mechanics which involves particles moving through space along deterministic trajectories. This theory singles out position as the primary ontological variable. Mathematically, it is possible to construct a similar theory where particles are moving through momentum-space, and momentum is singled out as the primary ontological variable. In this paper, we construct the putative particle trajectories for a two-slit experiment in both the position and momentum-space theories by simulating particle dynamics with coherent light. Using a method for constructing trajectories in the primary and non-primary spaces, we compare the phase-space dynamics offered by the two theories and show that they do not agree. This contradictory behaviour underscores the difficulty of selecting one picture of reality from the infinite number of possibilities offered by Bohm-like theories.},

As such, it is useful to benchmark the performance of such computers against specific tasks that may be of interest to users, ideally keeping both the circuit depth and width as free parameters. Here, we benchmark the IBM quantum experience using the deterministic quantum computing with 1 qubit (DQC1) algorithm originally proposed by Knill and Laflamme in the context of liquid-state NMR. In the first set of experiments, we use DQC1 as a trace estimation algorithm to benchmark performance with respect to circuit depth. In the second set, we use this trace estimation algorithm to distinguish between knots, a classically difficult task which is known to be complete for DQC1. Our results indicate that the main limiting factor is the depth of the circuit and that both random and systematic errors become an issue when the gate count increases. Surprisingly, we find that at the same gate count wider circuits perform better, probably due to randomization of coherent errors.},

Significantly, the simplicity allows application of the method to the successful reconstruction of MFPADs for polyatomic molecules. The scheme is demonstrated numerically for two realistic cases, \$N\_2\$ and \$C\_2H\_4\$.

  abstract  = {The radiation force from paraxial beams possessing helical phase fronts causes twists on the surface of an azobenzene polymer sample, and leads to the formation of micro-scale structures. Here, we theoretically investigate the radiation force generated by spatially structured optical beams on a dispersive-absorptive substrate. We derive an analytical expression for the radiation force from spatially structured polarized beams, including, lemon, star, monstar and vector vortex beams in the paraxial regime. Finally, we extend our calculation for non-paraxial beams - optical beams under the tight-focusing regime - and simulate the transverse radiation forces numerically at the focal plane.},

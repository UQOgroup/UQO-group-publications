# UQO group publications list

Ultrafast Quantum Optics (UQO) group publications list - ongoing group curated version.

The main `group_ongoing.bib` file is rendered via [BibBase](https://bibbase.org/) on [the group website](http://femtolab.ca/wordpress/?p=242).

## To edit

A few options:

1. **Easiest**: Sign in to Github with your UQOgroup credentials, then edit `group_ongoing.bib` directly [in the web interface (pencil icon at top right of the document)](https://github.com/UQOgroup/UQO-group-publications/blob/main/group_ongoing.bib).
2. Fork the repo to your own Github account, and make changes there - the web interface will also do this this if you are not signed in to the group account (you'll get a message that you can't edit directly).
3. Pull to a local copy and edit this.

In the latter cases, to update the main repo you'll either need to sign in as a group member, or send a pull request from your own Github account (this should, probably, auto-merge). To permanently allow editing from your own Github account, sign in as a group member then add your other account via Settings > Manage Access.
